# Project 1: Genome Assembly

This is the starting repository for Project 1.

If you don't have Jupyter installed, you'll need to install this first: `pip install jupyterlab` or see [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install) for more details and other options.

Then, you should do your work by editing the `project1.ipynb` notebook.

You'll be able to get started on the assignment by running:
`jupyter notebook project1.ipynb`.

You should work with your partner on this assignment (as discussed in [Class 2](https://computingbiology.github.io/class2)).
